This is the 2022 version of my personal portfolio website. This is a passion project, and I build it from scratch. I also took my time in creating it :D

This is a static website coded in plain ol' HTML, with a lot of SASS and some JS sprinkled over it. I have also tried to keep the markup semantic and accessible, though more work needs to be done on that.

I use [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) to build the pages. The website is hosted right here on GitHub pages.

Thanks for reading! Keep an eye out, I may update this readme with some more details in the future. In the meantime, feel free to poke around with the code.
