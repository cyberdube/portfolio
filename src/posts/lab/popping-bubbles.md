The theme for one of the Neos Creator Jams in May was called "Careless Whisper", where the idea was to create an ASMR-themed world or object in VR. I tried to bring the concept of popping bubbles into VR, with a satisfying 'pop' sound every time you popped a bubble. The bubbles keep respawning, so I found myself spending quite a bit of time just popping virtual bubbles in VR. A fun side effect of the interaction was that you could pop a bunch of bubbles at once by walking through the bubbles. I had a lot of fun creating this, and other Creator Jam makers also enjoyed the creation. I even published the final result as a shareable object inside of Neos, for other people to use in their worlds!
