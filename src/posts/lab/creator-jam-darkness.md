subtitle: Making a neon subway car in Neos VR

description:
    Creator Jam (CJ) is a weekly event in Neos VR, where people come together to build something based on a theme. For this edition, the theme was to fill a dark world with light. Together, me and my friend Obsidian created this subway tunnel inspired by K/DA's POP/STARS music video. We had a lot of fun creating this world, and we even made it such that other users can add their own graffiti art inside the subway car.
