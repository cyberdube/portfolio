        <p>
          I am a designer who loves tinkering and exploration. Working with
          emerging technology like VR, I create experiences that let us use our
          full range of human capabilities. I like 90s trip hop and downtempo
          music, doing fun DIY projects, and creating
          <a href="lab/pixelart">pixel art</a>.

            <h4>Design ðŸŽ¨</h4>
            <p>
              I combine visual, UX, and interaction design to create new
              experiences. The core of design to me involves defining the
              problem well and keeping the overall goal in mind at each step.

            <h4>Technology âš¡</h4>
            <p>
              I love tinkering with terminals and code; programming and
              prototyping are essential companions to my work. I also enjoy
              learning about the latest tech and tools.

            <h4>Ideation ðŸŒŸ</h4>
            <p>
              I am always seeking out creative solutions to problems. I do this
              by drawing inspiration from varied sources and mixing and matching
              concepts to create new perspectives.

            <h4>Collaboration ðŸ™Œ</h4>
            <p>
              I believe that the best work is done in a culture of
              collaboration. I thrive when I'm working with passionate
              peopleâ€”combining forces and creating impact together.

            <h4>Playfulness ðŸ‘»</h4>
            <p>
              Games and play are fun! But besides that, I also believe that a
              playful approach can often be beneficial to solve serious
              problems.

            <p>
              Great things can be built only through multidisciplinary,
              inclusive approaches. I value being adaptable and open at all
              times.

              I cherish being able to constantly learn (and unlearn) things.
