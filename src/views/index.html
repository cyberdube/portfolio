          Hi, Iâ€™m Savio. I create XR experiences that are social and playful by
          design. I love to ideate and prototype spatial interactions that push
          the boundaries of XR interfaces. Iâ€™m currently partnering with
          <a href="https://www.terrificminds.com/" target="_blank"
            >Terrific Minds</a
          >
          to create XR experiences for e-commerce and more.
